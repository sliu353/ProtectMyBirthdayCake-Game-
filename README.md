# ProtectMyBirthdayCake-Game-

This is a game I built utilising Unity3D game engine and Visual studio as a birthday gift for a friend. I used local git as back up. However, because once I accidently cleaned up the drive I store my code and git files, all the code of this game is lost. Fortunately I had the executable files and packages uploaded to my OneDrive and anyone are welcome to download and play.

Please make sure reading the Game introduction.docx before you play! Thanks.
